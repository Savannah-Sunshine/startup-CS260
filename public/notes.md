# Notes
#### You can use anything that you put in your notes.md file when taking the midterm or final.

## Topic 1: Github & Git
You know this. 
[Review here.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links)

## Topic 2: EC2
My instance: http://75.101.199.252/

`chmod 600 [key pair file]`

`ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]` exit with `exit`

The Caddyfile is the configuration file for your web service gateway. The public_html directory contains all of the static files that you are serving up directly through Caddy when using it as a web service. We will cover Caddy configuration in a later instruction. The services directory is the place where you are going to install all of your web services once you build them.


## Topic 3: HTTPS, TLS, and web certificates
The secure version of HTTP is called Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTPS). This is basically HTTP with a negotiated secure connection that happens before any data is exchanged. Having a secure connection means that all the data is encrypted using the TLS protocol. SSL is used sometimes to refer to TLS

You can see the actual negotiation with `curl -v -s https://byu.edu > /dev/null` (Does a handshake)

Enable https by getting a web certificate

# HTML

## [Topic 4: HTML structure elements](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.asp)

<html>	Defines an HTML document
<head>	Contains metadata/information for the document
<title>	Defines a title for the document
<body>	Defines the document's body
<h1> to <h6>	Defines HTML headings
<p>	Defines a paragraph
<br>	Inserts a single line break
<hr>	Defines a thematic change in the content
<!--...-->	comment
<ol>	Defines an ordered list

<strong> <b> text bold

The header contains a paragraph with a span, and a navigation containing multiple fdivisions of sub-content.

The main contains multiple sections that contain either an unordered list (ul) or a table. Main also contains an aside for content that does not fit the content flow of the sections.

The footer has a content division with a single span.

### Block and inline
block element is meant to be a distinct block in the flow of the content structure. An inline element is meant to be inline with the content flow of a block element.
    
    Block elements: `div`, `p` (paragraph)
   
    Inline elements: `b`, `span`

`Links:` <a href="https://www.byu.edu/">BYU</a>

`Image links:` <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" style="width:100px;height:100px;">

`Tables: `
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>1 row 1 col<td>
        <td>1 row 2 col</td>
    <tr>
 </table>

## Topic 5: HTML media
EX: img, audio, video, svg, and canvas. The img, audio, and video elements are all simple references to an external file, but svg and canvas both contain the code to render a visual image that can even be animated.

`<img alt="mountain landscape" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg" />`

`<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>`

`<video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
  `<source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />`
</video`

Crossorigin needed if the video is not from your site.


`<svg viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="red" fill="red" style="border: 1px solid #000000">
  <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" />
</svg>`

# CSS

## Topic 6: CSS Flexbox
`flex` display layout is useful when you want to partition your application into areas that responsively move around as the window resizes or the orientation changes

Make th e body element into a responsive flexbox by including `display: flex` in CSS

`flex-direction: row` that the children are oriented side by side.

### Small screen sizes
Use `@media`

Set `flex-direction: column`

## Topic 7: CSS Frameworks
Tailwind: it uses smaller definitions that are applied specifically to individual HTML elements. This moves much of the CSS representation out of the CSS file and directly into the HTML.

Bootstrap: Referencing the Bootstrap CSS files then add the HTML link elements to your head element.
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/

Here's an [example](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/JjZavjW?editors=1100) of using bootstrap components.

# Javascript

| Function | Meaning                                                   | Example                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| push     | Add an item to the end of the array                       | `a.push(4)`                   |
| pop      | Remove an item from the end of the array                  | `x = a.pop()`                 |
| slice    | Return a sub-array                                        | `a.slice(1,-1)`               |
| sort     | Run a function to sort an array in place                  | `a.sort((a,b) => b-a)`        |
| values   | Creates an iterator for use with a `for of` loop          | `for (i of a.values()) {...}` |
| find     | Find the first item satisfied by a test function          | `a.find(i => i < 2)`          |
| forEach  | Run a function on each array item                         | `a.forEach(console.log)`      |

| some     | Run a function to test if any items match                 | `a.some(i => 1 < 1)`          |

## Topic 9: DOM
Document Object Model (DOM) is an object representation of the HTML elements that the browser uses to render the display. The browser also exposes the DOM to external code so that you can write programs that dynamically manipulate the HTML.

## Midterm
#title selects by element ID, while .grid selects by element class.

The padding applies to spacing between the element and its border. The margin applies to spacing between the border and other adjacent elements.

Default display value for most elements is block or inline (change to flex or grid if desired)

p.header { color:green; } <- is a possible CSS thing


# [Express](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServices/express/express.md)

 Express revolves around creating and using HTTP routing and middleware functions. 

 HTTP endpoints are implemented in Express by defining routes that call a function based upon an HTTP path. The Express app object supports all of the HTTP verbs as functions on the object. For example, if you want to have a route function that handles an HTTP GET request for the URL path /store/provo you would call the get method on the app.

`app.get('/store/provo', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({name: 'provo'});
});`

- get function takes two parameters, a URL path matching pattern, and a callback function that is invoked when the pattern matches. The path matching parameter is used to match against the URL path of an incoming HTTP request.
- callback function has three parameters that represent the HTTP request object (req), the HTTP response object (res), and the next routing function that Express expects to be called if this routing function wants another function to generate a response.


routing functions are only called if the associated pattern matches. Middleware functions are always called for every HTTP request unless a preceding middleware function does not call next. A middleware function has the following pattern:
`function middlewareName(req, res, next)`

EX: Log out the URL of request
`app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.originalUrl);
  next();
});`


simple error handler for anything that might go wrong while processing HTTP requests you could add the following.

`app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  res.status(500).send({type: err.name, message: err.message});
});`

# [Fetch](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServices/fetch/fetch.md)
 fetch takes a URL and returns a promise. 
 the fetch API is the preferred way to make HTTP requests

 ex: 
 `fetch('https://quote.cs260.click')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((jsonResponse) => {
    console.log(jsonResponse);
  });
`
